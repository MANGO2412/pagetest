                  <div className="leading-loose text-wrap">
                     <p>
                        Radionics is concerned with the context of control fields and “subtle energies”. 
                        The term “subtle energies” refers in this context to those forms of energy which cannot presently be objectively (physically) measured, 
                        because they are signals of very low amplitude which are masked due to the component “noise” of electrical equipment.
                     </p>
                     <p >
                     The use of radionics in humans, animals and plants through radionic instruments is used practically 
                     to balance the subtle energy field of the subject, and a sample of the subject in question is placed 
                     in the input cup/plate when going about this task.
                     </p>
                     <p >
                     Since radionics is used for that main purpose, upon discovering which and where 
                     are the ailments you can then focus the radionic rates to produce, 
                     or remind, per say, a balancing effect of the body at subtle energetic levels.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     Radionics can also be used to provide broadcasting sessions, 
                     or distance treatment sessions, where the presence of the subject to receive 
                     the therapy does not need to be located near the radionic instrument, 
                     meaning that distance is irrelevant for it to take effect (similar to, but not clinging to, super-positioning).
                     </p>
                     <p >
                     Sample collection may be tricky at first, but if you follow a methodical procedure it is the best reference source when providing biofeedback when diagnosing. 
                     In the course of time, however, various subjective methods have been developed, such as radiesthesia, kinesiology, RAC, 
                     electro-acupuncture etc, by means of which it is possible to perform reproducible measurements in this context.

                    <div className="leading-8 text-wrap">
                        <p>The principles of present-day radionics were laid down by the American doctor, Dr Albert Abrams (1863-1924).</p>

                         <p>In the context of his work into differentiation between various symptoms by means
                         of an automatic reflex movement of the stomach of a patient detected by percussion. 
                         He discovered an empirically defined arrangement of variable resistances (potentiometer).</p>
                         <p>In this context, the patient was connected via a forehead electrode to the “input” of a variable resistance box. 
                            At the “output”, a healthy person was connected, also via a forehead electrode (Test person). On the abdomen of the test person, it was now possible to diagnose the pathology of the patient on the basis of settings of the decade resistance by means of the special knock reflex. 
                            It was not until later that Abrams found that it was not even necessary for the patient himself to be present.</p>
                         <p>
                         It was adequate for him to be replaced by a blood sample (as a “specimen” or “proof”). 
                         This specimen was poured into a metal cup which (in place of the patient) was 
                         connected to the “Input” of the variable resistance box.
                         </p>

                    <div className="leading-8 text-wrap">
                         <p>
                         For example, with this layout, Abrams discovered that cancer can be measured at 50 Ohms, 
                         gonorrhoea at 52 Ohms etc. If the blood specimen of a cancer sufferer was poured into the 
                         metal cup and the variable resistance box set to 50, on the abdomen of the test person a positive reflex would be obtained. 
                         If on the other hand for the same patient specimen a setting of 52 (gonorrhoea) was set on the variable resistance box, 
                         this positive reflex disappeared (provided that the patient was not also suffering from gonorrhoea). 
                         Thus, Abrams developed a series of lists on which organs, symptoms, viruses, bacteria, etc. 
                         were allocated to empirically determined resistance values.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          With this rate and the variable resistance box, 
                          it was thus possible to diagnose a patient on the basis of his blood specimen and to reach 
                          conclusions as to the conditions of his organs etc.

                   <div className="leading-8 text-wrap">
                      <p>
                       Abrams also found out that this layout made it possible to examine the effect of medicines, particularly homoeopathy. 
                        He poured into the cup containing the patient specimen a corresponding medicine. 
                        If this medicine helped the patient with his condition, then the positive reflex on the abdomen of the test person would disappear.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If, for example, the specimen of a malaria patient was poured into the cup and the corresponding value for malaria had been set on the variable resistance box, 
                        on the abdomen of the test person a positive reflex would be obtained. If a medicine to cure malaria, such as Quinine, 
                        was combined with the patient specimen in the cup, then the positive reflex would disappear, 
                        i.e. quinine would help this patient to combat malaria.

                           Ruth Drown was the first person to use the radionic instrument not only for diagnosis 
                           but also for therapy. She discovered that this therapy also operated over distance, 
                           if a blood specimen of the patient was laid on the instrument. 
                           Her explanation of this phenomenon was that the rates exert a background presence 
                           in the “atmosphere” and can be received by a person. The setting of a 
                           “rate” on the instrument would set up a resonance in relation to 
                           this rate between the instrument and the patient, and thus increase the person’s 
                           “receptivity effect”. She named this process “Broadcasting”, 
                           a reference to the radio technology which was emerging at that time.

                      <div className="leading-loose text-wrap">
                          <p>
                           The ideas of Ruth Drown are still to be found today 
                           in the theory of the “morphogenetic fields” of the English biologist and philosopher Rupert Sheldrake. 
                           Sheldrake works on the assumption that the morphogenetic fields contain all information concerning the 
                           structure and form of each organism, including “inanimate” material. These fields have a holographic structure, 
                           which means that the corresponding information is theoretically omnipresent in the universe and can be called up 
                           accordingly. The morphogenetic fields are not essentially electromagnetic and are presumably on a plane other than 
                           space/time.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          The existence of such a plane transcending space/time has even been postulated as an inevitability by some physicists. 
                          David Bohm, in this connection, refers to a “holographic universe” and defines the two areas of existence as having an 
                          “implicit” (folded-up) and “explicit” (unfolded) order.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The physicist Burkhard Heim, believes that in addition to our three spatial dimensions and time as the fourth 
                           dimension (= space/time) there exist further transcendent dimensions to which humanity can refer, 
                           thanks to the particular characteristics of his awareness. In these higher dimensions (hyper space) there is information
                            which controls the structure and processes of the lower dimensions via ”synkopes”! This hyperspace thus performs 
                            the function of a control field. The interesting feature of Heim’s 
                            “quantum field theory” is that it can provide more precise information after the material world (e.g. 
                            the mass of electrons) than – for example – quantum theory. Furthermore, the Heim theory also provides information about 
                            the intangible world, i.e. the areas which Dr. Bruce Copen designated dimension X.

                           The radionic instrument enables the therapist to call up information specific to the patient from the control fields 
                           (dimensions 7 & 8 according to Heim, Sheldrake’s morphogenetic fields) and thus to analyse the underlying causes of disease 
                           in a person, animal or plant. The experienced practitioner knows that he can tune himself via this plane to the patient 
                           provided that he has a blood or hair specimen of the patient, wherever the patient is, even if they are thousands of 
                           kilometers apart. At the same time, deviations can be qualitatively assessed and balanced by radionic therapy.

                          To sum up, it can be stated that radionics gives you the possibility of setting up an extensive analysis on
                           the basis of a patient specimen. In this context, you can take account of the organ status, toxin loading, vitamin and minerals budget, bacteria and viral presence, fungal infections etc. You can test the appropriate homoeopathic remedy and potency without the use of test sets, and assess the correct Bach flower or other flower essences. Furthermore, you have the complete range of colour and precious stone therapy available to you. For this purpose we have numerous rates available (6500 rates for organs and symptoms, 30 rates for 
                          vitamins, 320 rates for colour, 2600 rates for homoeopathic remedies, and flower essences etc).
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          The Copen radionic instruments also give you the facility not only of investigating at 
                          physical level but also operating at astral and mental levels etc. Depending on the instrument, 
                          you have access to 6 or 12 levels of existence.
                          </p>

                          With the Electronic Vibro Potentiser (EVP) you can, by radionic means, 
                          imprint the specific informational content of any given subject substances in virtually arbitrary 
                          potency on carrier substances such as globules (lactose balls), alcohol etc.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          Naturally, Copen radionic instruments also give you the facility for radionic balancing (braodcasting).
